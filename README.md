# bearer-auth /bearer-auth and JWT

### Description:

in this lab I've used the code from the previous lab as a tarter code with a little bit of refactoring, I've moved the databse functionalities to the user model itself, and implemented the use of the jwt, to check if a valid token, send a get request to the endpoint ("/secretstuff") with the correct token.
